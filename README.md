## EIP712 Offchain Signatures Toolkit 


#### Getting Started
First, modify the file 'eip-712-config.json' to your liking 

Then, modify 'dataValues' variable in both '/test/ganacheTest.js' and in 'index.js'

Then, run the 'build, compile, test' commands to build and test associated solidity files for your EIP712 project

Use the Helper and Utils libraries along with your eip712-config.json file in your frontend web3 project to interact with that solidity code ! 


#### Commands: 
    npm install 
    npm run build 


    npm run compile 
    npm run test
